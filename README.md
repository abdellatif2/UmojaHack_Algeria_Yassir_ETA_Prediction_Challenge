# UmojaHack Algeria: Yassir ETA Prediction Challenge
 My Team Solution to UmojaHack Algeria: Yassir ETA Prediction Challenge
 
 Established in 2017, Yassir is the leading ride-hailing company in Algeria. It covers all major Algerian cities and is expanding its services to Tunisia, Morocco and France. Besides ride-hailing services, Yassir is making customersâ€™ lives easier by providing diversified services such as goods and food delivery as well as telemedicine.

Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Yassir rely on real-time data and machine learning algorithms to automate their services.

***The objective of this hackathon is to predict the estimated time of arrival at the dropoff point for a single Yassir journey.***
